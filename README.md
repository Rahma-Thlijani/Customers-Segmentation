# Customers-Segmentation
## Project Overview
We will work on a customer dataset, our goal is to apply customer segmentation on this historical data. Customer segmentation is the practice of partitioning a customer base into groups of individuals that have similar characteristics. It is a significant strategy as a business can target these specific groups of customers and effectively allocate marketing resources. For example, one group might contain customers who are high-profit and low-risk, that is, more likely to purchase products, or subscribe for a service. 

To identify customer segments hidden in the data, we will apply an unsupervised learning technique. We will first understand, manipulate, and process the dataset. Thereafter, we will focus on **Visualizing the data using different plots such as Heatmap, Pairplot, Boxplot, Distributionplot, Countplot and histogram aiming to reveal and analyze the data insights.** Then, we will implement a clustering algorithm (K-mean) to segment the customer data. Finally, we will visualize the segmentation found (clusters) and analyze them.
## Data Description
We have the customers dataset "customer.csv". It has 850 rows and 10 columns containing the customers' information such as 'Customer Id', 'Age', 'Eduucation', 'Years Employed',
'Income', etc.
